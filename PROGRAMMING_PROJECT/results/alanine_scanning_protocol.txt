Alanine Scanning Protocol – Spike RBD–ACE2 Interface

1. Starting structure:
   - 6m0j_prepared.pdb / 6m0j_prepared.pdbqt
   - Chains A (RBD) and E (ACE2)
   - Hydrogens and Gasteiger charges included

2. Interface definition:
   - Fixed residue lists (see interface_chain_A.txt and interface_chain_E.txt)
   - Interface residues were not re-identified after mutation

3. Mutation model:
   - One residue at a time mutated to alanine
   - Backbone coordinates kept fixed
   - Side-chain atoms beyond CB removed
   - No structural relaxation or minimization

4. Energy evaluation:
   - Same force field parameters as WT
   - Same electrostatic, van der Waals and solvation models
   - Interaction energies recomputed using int_energies_AE.py

5. ΔΔG definition:
   ΔΔG_res = ΔG_mutant − ΔG_WT

6. Interpretation:
   - ΔΔG > 0: destabilizing mutation
   - ΔΔG < 0: stabilizing mutation
